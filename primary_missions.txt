Primary Mission
Hidden Supplies

In the Place Objective Markers step, players must set up one additional objective marker in No Man's Land.

Before setting up this new objective marker, players must first move the objective marker in the center of the battlefield 6" directly towards one of the corners of the battlefield (if No Man's Land touches any of the corners of the battlefield, you must move the objective marker towards one of those corners). Otherwise, the players roll-off, and the winner selects which corner the objective marker is moved towards. Players then set up the new objective marker 6" from the center of the battlefield towards the diagonally opposite corner of the battlefield to the previously moved objective marker.
